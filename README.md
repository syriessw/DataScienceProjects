# üìä My Data Projects & Automation Scripts

Welcome to my collection of personal data projects, capstone projects, and Python automation scripts! This repository highlights my achievements through data analysis, machine learning, and process automation, showcasing key skills in Python, Power BI, and project development.

## üîç Projects Overview

### 1. **Capstone Projects**
   - **Sailfort Motors Churn Prediction**: Developed machine learning models to predict employee churn based on fictional motor insurance dataset. Optimised accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
   - **Refer to IBMDataScience** for the SpaceX Prediction project

### 2. **Personal Data Projects**
   - **Customer Churn Prediction**: Developed machine learning models to predict customer churn based on the Telco dataset. Optimized accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
   - **Titanic Dataset Analysis**: Performed EDA and imputation techniques to predict passenger survival rates using Decision Tree and XGBRegressor.
   - **RAG LLMs**: Creating a Retrieval Augmented Generation pipeline using LangChain and LLMs to retrieve information from loaded PDF and some web sites.

### 3. **Python Automation Scripts**
   - **Task Automation with BAT file and Python scripts**: Created Python workflows to reduce repetitive tasks, saving over 60 hours of manual work across projects. Portion of the work cannot be shown.
