    "__What is a RAG?__\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Simply put, RAGs help LLMs by giving them access to external data so that they can generate a response with additional context. This context can be anything from recent news, audio transcripts of a lecture, or in my case — fantasy football news.\n",

    "Here are the 4 key steps that take place:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load a vector database with encoded documents.\n",
    "- Encode the query into a vector using a sentence transformer.\n",
    "- Based on the inputted query, retrieve relevant context from thevector database.\n",
    "- Leverage context along with the query to prompt the LLM.\n",

    "__Off-the-shelf chains:__ A structured assembly of various components and modules to accomplish a specific task such as summarization, Q&A, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain has six main components to build LLM applications: model I/O, Data connections, Chains, Memory, Agents, and Callbacks.

The key features to note are efficient model architecture as it was designed to optimize performance by reducing computational overhead, being an open-weight models, having smal model size but high performance and is designed for real-time use cases."

It's very filling. I recommend using Żywiec Porter, a wonderful Polish import, but any full bodied dark beer will do.  So sit down, toss a coin to your Witcher, and eat some hearty beer potage.

      "Beer Potage In The Blood of Elves, Ciri and Triss are enjoying dinner at Kaer Morhen, dinner being \"beer potage, thick with cheese and croutons.\" Potage is a French word, meaning a thick and creamy soup. Initially, I was thinking this was along the lines of German beer and cheddar soup, but apparently Polish beer soup is a little different. It's heavier and sweet, almost like a smooth porridge. It's very filling. I recommend using Żywiec Porter, a wonderful Polish import, but any full bodied dark beer will do.  So sit down, toss a coin to your Witcher, and eat some hearty beer potage.

Once the ﬁrst ﬁllet is in, move the pot back and forth in order to prevent the ﬁsh from sticking to the bottom. Oil should be gently bubbling away and your eyes ever watchful.  13.Fry each ﬁllet 3-5 minutes, ﬂipping with a holed spatula halfway through. Whenever the batter is golden and crisp, that will be the cue to ﬁsh out your now golden clouds of ﬂavor. 14.Let the ﬁsh rest on a paper towel for a few minutes.
